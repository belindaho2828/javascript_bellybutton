# Summary
The Belly Button Biodiversity project, initiated in January 2011, offers a fascinating exploration into the microbial communities inhabiting human navels, a relatively unexplored ecosystem. The study aimed to investigate the diverse microbes residing in this moist and protected area of the body, as well as the factors influencing their presence. 

By cataloging these microbial species, known as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), the dataset highlights that a small number of these OTUs were prevalent in over 70% of individuals, while the remaining OTUs were less common.

The interactive dashboard allows users to explore the dataset of the study by selecting the test subject ID of interest and retrieving their demographic info, top 10 bacteria cultures found, and number of bacteria cultures found per sample.
